# Script Generation Prompt

Generate a script. Its purpose is to update an index page which can be found at the base of this Github repository. 

The script will need to know that it's not being executed from the repository base. So it will need to have logic to recurse in the file system until it reaches it. 

At the base of the repository, the script will encounter a text file called repolist.txt

This will contain a list of Github repository Urls. These should be formatted as one URL per line, but the script should be able to Distinguish between Urls even if the expected formatting is not properly adhered to. 

For its AI functions, the script can use Deepseek's API.

The purpose of the script is to create and update an index page at README.md (at the root of the repository).

The README page is an alphabetically ordered list of repositories That is created based upon the URL list. 

The script should be written in a way that it is designed to be run repetitively without creating duplicate data. If the script requires a memory file in order to store data, it can create one at the base of the repository itself. 

The script We'll need to be able to generate a title and description for the repository. If an additional API is required for this functionality, please choose the most appropriate one. Appropriate way to store the API key secrets. I can provide them in a env at the base of the repository. Or as secrets in the Github repository itself. 

Here is an example of the way in which the script should format each Github repository. The description describes the purpose of the Assistant configuration, which can be determined by analyzing the README file at the base of the repository listed. 

# Daniel Beer Finder

This assistant creates a configuration for a beer finding assistant which uses vision capabilities to recommend beer for the user. 

)This is the end of the example).

The README file will be directly edited every time unless there are no changes to the repository list. If a repository was previously included in the list but has been removed, then the script must have logic to delete it from the index. Otherwise, its only function is to add new repositories in the appropriate place (according to their alphabetical order)

# Alternative Approaches

If you think that directly editing the README file is too complicated and you can think of a better approach for implementing the desired functionality, such as using an intermediate data storage format, then please develop the script according to that direction.
